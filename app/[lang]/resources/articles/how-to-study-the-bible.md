## Introduction

Studying the Bible is more than reading words on a page. It is a spiritual discipline that draws us closer to God.

## 1. Begin With Prayer

Always ask the Holy Spirit to guide your understanding.

## 2. Observe the Text Carefully

Pay attention to:

- Who is speaking  
- To whom  
- In what context  

## 3. Apply the Word Personally

The goal is not information only, but transformation.
